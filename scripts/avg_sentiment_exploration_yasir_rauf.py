"""This script is a part of our Digital Humanities Mini Project No. 3, where we are learning different ways to visualize data using Python.
In this script, I am exploring different methods to visualize my own created DataFrame named "avg_sentiment_results.csv", which is located inside the
outputs/sentiment analysis folder of FASDH25-portfolio3 repository. I start by creating a bar chart using absolute counts, then move on to relative counts,
and finally, through a scatter plot.

All the visualization code blocks are currently commented out because running them all together can cause errors — one visualization might interfere
with another. If you want to explore a specific visualization, just remove the comment (i.e., the #) from the line of code you’re interested in and run
it. This way, you’ll get the exact visualization you want to see."""
